          <h2>Regarding Our Security Officers:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Every officer undergoes extensive training, possesses exceptional
              skills, and is an integral part of a unified and coordinated
              support system. Their prominent presence at the site serves as a
              powerful deterrent.
            </li>
            <li>
              They go through a thorough selection procedure, including a
              10-year criminal record examination. Additionally, they must
              successfully comply with all applicable government regulations,
              and we ensure they obtain all essential accreditations to meet the
              continuously changing legal prerequisite
            </li>
            <li>
              They must complete a first aid course and, thanks to our
              continuous in-house workshops, they also receive essential
              training in public relations skills and non-violent restraint
              techniques.

            </li>
            <li>
              Every officer wears a uniform and works to safeguard property
              through a prominent presence that discourages unlawful or improper
              behavior. They monitor for indications of criminal activity, fire
              hazards, vandalism, or disturbances, either by direct observation,
              patrolling, or monitoring alarm systems and video cameras.
              Subsequently, they respond to incidents and promptly notify their
              supervisor, the client, and emergency services if necessary
